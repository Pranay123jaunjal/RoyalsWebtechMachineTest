A simple to-do list application with user authentication and task management capabilities. Built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.

Features
User Authentication: Register, log in, and log out.
Task Management: Create, view, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
Persistent Data: Stores user and task data in MongoDB.
Secure: Uses JWT for secure user authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Axios for API requests
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT for secure, stateless authentication

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed
MongoDB running locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas
Git for cloning the repository


Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-app.git
cd to-do-app
2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables by creating a .env file in the backend folder:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

3. Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.

4. Verify Connection
Access the frontend at http://localhost:3000 and try registering, logging in, adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
Check the developer console and network requests to confirm API requests are sent to the backend at http://localhost:5000.
Dependencies
Backend
Express: For server-side routing and handling HTTP requests.
Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
jsonwebtoken: For handling JWT-based authentication.
bcryptjs: For password hashing.
Frontend
React: For building the user interface.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
Approach
Backend
The backend is structured around a RESTful API that follows MVC principles:

Controllers handle business logic for authentication and task management.
Models define the structure of user and task documents in MongoDB.
Middleware (authMiddleware) verifies JWT tokens for secure routes.
Each route in the backend serves a single purpose, following CRUD principles for task operations and creating endpoints for user authentication.

Frontend
The frontend uses React with functional components and hooks for state and effect management. It includes the following key components:

Auth Components: Handle registration and login. They communicate with the backend to authenticate users.
TodoList Component: Allows users to add, delete, update, and mark tasks as complete. It uses api.js (Axios) to handle requests to the backend.
Axios Instance: Configured in src/services/api.js to include the JWT token in every request, stored in localStorage upon login.
Security
JWT: For stateless authentication, with the token included in Authorization headers for requests that require user verification.
Password Hashing: bcrypt hashes passwords before storing them in MongoDB.
